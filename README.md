# Mini-ATM
## Welcome to Mini-ATM, where innovation meets convenience. I am the brainchild behind this project, dedicated to replicating the functionality of a traditional ATM machine in a compact, user-friendly form.

## My name is Yogesh Saini, and I'm passionate about creating practical solutions using object-oriented programming principles. With a strong foundation in C++, I embarked on the journey to develop Mini-ATM, aiming to provide users with seamless banking experiences from the comfort of their homes.
